Here are some helper scripts that are handy when using synctool.

It's a bit of hodge-podge collection of related scripts that have
been in use over the years. You don't necessarily need these scripts,
but might come in handy. They are provided AS IS and WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. The respective authors can not be held responsible
for any damage done by these scripts.


Files in this directory:

functions._none
  A collection of files to be used by tasks, for package management and service management.
  See instructions inside.

whitelist.post
  Script that does two things:
  - on a management node, creates a whitelist of files not to be cleaned up
  - on a cluster node, cleanes up the directory.
  It's far from perfect but perhaps a good starting point.

synctool-diff
  Compares files across a cluster, managed by synctool or not.

  Compare file in synctool overlay tree with file on node:
    synctool-diff node:/path/file

  Compare files on nodes or local:
     synctool-diff [node1:]/path1/file1 [node2:]/path2/file2
