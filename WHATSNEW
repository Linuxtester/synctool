What's new in synctool version 4.7 ? 
====================================

IMPORTANT UPGRADING INFO

This version includes a subtle yet major installation change that makes
sysadmin-ing synctool itself a lot easier.
Previously, you had to upgrade the nodes with 'make client_install'.
This step is no longer needed. However, for synctool to install
correctly, do the following:

    1. run 'make install'
    2. edit /var/lib/synctool/synctool.conf
       change the line with 'synctool_cmd' to:

synctool_cmd /var/lib/synctool/sbin/synctool.py -c /var/lib/synctool/synctool.conf

    3. run 'synctool -qa'

synctool upgrade complete, on the entire cluster!

What did just happen? synctool version 4.7 installs all its commands
under /var/lib/synctool/sbin/. This directory gets synced to the clients
whenever you run synctool on the master node. This means that your
client synctool software is being kept up to date automatically from
the master node.
On the master node itself, the commands under /opt/synctool/sbin/ all
link to /var/lib/synctool/sbin/. This guarantees that the master and the
client run the same version of synctool.
The old client installations of synctool software are no longer needed,
so as a step 4 you may do:

    4. dsh -x masternode rm -rf /opt/synctool/sbin


What else is new?
This version includes two very nice contributions:

   * synctool-diff  by Onno Zweers
     which uses the graphical diff tool 'meld'

   * .bash_completion definition by Tim Dittler
     which quickens typing long synctool options in bash

See the contrib/ directory for these useful contributions.
Many thanks go to Onno and Tim!

See the Changelog for other changes to synctool.



Some info on older changes (version 4.6) is listed here:

- Version 4.6.1 is a bugfix release to 4.6
  It also contains contributed control files needed for making .deb packages
  for the Debian GNU/Linux OS, which can be found under contrib/debian/



What's new in synctool version 4.6 ?
====================================

Aside from a few minor bug fixes, version 4.6 includes two new features
that both have to do with group definitions in synctool's config file:

 1, groups 'all' and 'none' are now built-in groups.
    group 'all' applies to all nodes. Group 'none' is ignored by default.
    It can be used on files in the synctool repository that must not be
    synced right now, but maybe later.

    The fact that 'all' and 'none' are built-in now means that you can
    remove them from synctool's config file -- but read below.

    The built-in groups 'all' and 'none' may be overridden if you define
    them yourself, but really, you shouldn't.

 2. 'compound groups' may be defined. This is convenient if you have many
    nodes that are in the same set of groups. Example:
 
     group wn workernode batch mounthome plasma solar ldapclient

     node n1 master
     node n2 login mounthome
     node n3 wn
     node n4 wn
     node n5 wn
     node n6 wn othergroup
     node n7 moreimportantgroupfirst wn

    Compound groups may be combined, too:

     group bigwn somegroup othergroup wn


    Original idea of compound groups was by Tim Dittler.



Upgrading info
==============

Upgrade synctool as usual. I always upgrade the server first, and then the
clients. After upgrading, you may delete the groups 'all' and 'none' from
the synctool.conf file.   The synctool.conf file is located under
/var/lib/synctool (by default).

NB. If you remove the groups 'all' and 'none' from the config file before
upgrading and then run synctool, you may end up with nodes being unable to
parse the config file. If you get stuck like this, change the config file
back and use 'dcp /var/lib/synctool/synctool.conf' to restore the working
config file on the nodes.
After that, upgrade in the proper way.
