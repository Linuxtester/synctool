In 'synctool terminology', a "node" is a host, a computer in a group of
computers. A group of computers is called a cluster.


First of all, synctool requires passwordless SSH from the master node to
each cluster node as root. Exactly how to do this is beyond the scope
of this document (see the SSH documentation or just google around), but
I'd like to say this about it:
 * use SSH keypairs
 * or use hostbased authentication, also for root
 * set sshd_config PermitRootLogin without-password
 * run sshd only the internal network interface to secure your system
 * in general, passwordless SSH from any cluster node to your master node
   should _not_ work; at least, synctool does not need this

For sites with extra tight security, it is possible to configure ssh to run
only specific (synctool) commands, or maybe you want to change the
ssh_cmd in the configuration so that it runs a different command, that
suits your security needs.

When passwordless SSH as root works, proceed to installing the software.


Edit the provided Makefile and adjust PREFIX to point to your
desired location where the software should reside. Some prefer
/usr/local, others prefer /usr/local/synctool, while others
prefer /opt. Pick whatever you think is best.

On your master node, run 'make install'. This copies the commands
to the selected location and sets up symlinks for:

  synctool -> synctool_master.py
  synctool-config -> synctool_config.py
  synctool-ssh -> synctool_ssh.py
  dsh -> synctool_ssh.py
  synctool-scp -> synctool_scp.py
  dcp -> synctool_scp.py
  synctool-aggr -> synctool_aggr.py

It also creates the master repository under /var/lib/synctool/
Copy the synctool.conf.example to /var/lib/synctool/synctool.conf
and edit it, adjusting it as needed.

synctool.conf describes what your cluster looks like; what nodes
have what roles, and how can synctool contact them?
Think a bit about what role each machine has. There is no need to
go into great depth right now; you can always adjust the configuration
later.
In general, it is good practice to always put a node into group 'all':

  node n1 all interface:machine-n01

The nodename is the 'synctool name that the node has'. It is in general the
short hostname of the host, but in fact it can be anything you like. The
nodename has nothing to do with hostnames or DNS entries.
The interface specifies how synctool can contact the node; this can be an
IP address or a DNS name of the host you wish to contact. In clusters, there
is often a management network interface -- configure that interface name
here.

It is also good practice to label your master node as 'master' or 'install'.

  node n1 master all interface:machine-n01

Now n1 responds to the groups 'n1', 'master', and 'all'.

Some people don't like managing the master node itself with synctool.
While it _is_ possible and perfectly alright to do this, some like to
exclude the master node by default:

  ignore_node n1


You have to list each and every host.
In the contrib/ directory, there is a script that uses nmap ping with
which you can scan your management network and quickly turn it into
a synctool configuration. This makes life a bit easier.


Try the command 'dsh hostname', 'dsh uptime', or 'dsh date'.
If you correctly set up passwordless SSH, dsh should run the commands
on every node without problems or needed manual intervention.
It is important that this works, before proceeding.

NB. Some (mostly IBM) systems already have a 'dsh' command. In synctool,
    'dsh' is a symbolic link to synctool-ssh
    The same goes for 'dcp', which is a symlink to synctool-scp


Now that you have a rough setup on the master node, you also need to
install client side software on every cluster node. As synctool is
not fully functional yet, you can't use synctool to do this.

SSH to a node and unpack the tarball. Edit the Makefile as before.
Run 'make client_install'.

An easy way to copy the package to all nodes, is by using the synctool-scp
or 'dcp' command. An easy way to deploy it is by using dsh.
You may also use contrib/bootstrap-synctool-client.sh to install clients.

Note that by default, synctool will install to /opt/synctool
so if you don't like this, you have to change it.


After installing all client software, give the command 'synctool' on
the master node a go.
There should be some output about 'DRY RUN'. This means that synctool
is now working and you can start filling your repository with useful files.
