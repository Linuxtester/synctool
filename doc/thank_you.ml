<h2 id="thank_you">6. Thank you</h2>
<p>
There are a number of people I wish to thank. First of all, a big thanks goes
out to all synctool users. Special thanks go to those whom I've had e-mail
conversations with about synctool. And last but not least, very special thanks
go to those who contributed to synctool in one way or another. synctool would
not be what it is today without their contributions.

If you also want to contribute to synctool, drop me an e-mail. If you are a
programmer who likes to contribute to the development of synctool, please
fork the <a href="https://github.com/walterdejong/synctool">github project</a>
and issue pull requests. If you don't know how git works, patches in
<span class="cmd">diff -u</span> format are always welcome too. However,
I highly recommend using git and github.
