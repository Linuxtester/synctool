<h2 id="part_one">1. What is synctool</h2>
<div class="chapter">
synctool is a tool that can help you administer your cluster of computers.
It is meant for copying configuration files to groups (or classes) of
computers within a cluster.
There are other tools in existence that do the same thing, and ironically,
none of them are as easy to understand and use as synctool.
<p>
synctool simplifies things by working with the following concepts:
<ul>
<li>a host can be part of a logical group;
<li>files are designated a group by means of filename extension;
<li>the &lsquo;overlay&rsquo; directory tree contains the files
that are synced to the target hosts;
<li>when certain files are updated, you will want to execute a script;
(e.g, <span class="system">/etc/init.d/daemon restart</span>)
<li>simplicity. synctool uses the power of <span class="cmd">rsync</span>
and <span class="cmd">ssh</span> to distribute the files;
<li>extendibility. Make synctool more powerful by writing plugin scripts.
</ul>
synctool manages configuration files, not processes, and not full system
installations. However, synctool does more than just this. synctool is
extensible in the sense that it can run scripts on hosts (via the
&lsquo;tasks&rsquo; mechanism). This is primarily meant to do synchronized
updates of software packages on all systems in the cluster, but can also be
used to check daemons, or perform other system administration tasks.<br>
synctool does not hide <span class="smallcaps">UNIX</span> from you.
Making clever use of synctool makes it a very powerful tool.
<p>
synctool is successfully being used to administer several clusters at the
Dutch national supercomputer facility for over 7 years now. Hopefully
it will be of some value to you as well.

<h2 id="part_two">2. Installation</h2>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="note">
In synctool terminology, a &ldquo;node&rdquo; is a host, a computer in a group of
computers. A group of computers is called a cluster.
</div>
<p>
<h3>Passwordless SSH</h3>
First of all, synctool requires passwordless SSH from the master node to
each cluster node as root. Exactly how to do this is beyond the scope
of this document (see the SSH documentation or just google around), but
I'd like to say this about it:
<ul>
<li>use SSH keypairs
<li>or use hostbased authentication, also for root
<li>set <span class="path">sshd_config</span> <span class="system">PermitRootLogin without-password</span>
<li>run <span class="cmd">sshd</span> only the internal network interface to secure your system
<li>in general, passwordless SSH from any cluster node to your master node
should <em>not</em> work or be allowed; or at least, synctool does not need this
</ul>
For sites with extra tight security, it is possible to configure ssh to run
only specific (synctool) commands, or maybe you want to change the
ssh_cmd in the configuration so that it runs a different command, that
suits your security needs.
<p>
When passwordless SSH as root works, proceed to installing the software.
<p>
<h3>make install</h3>
Edit the provided <span class="cmd">Makefile</span> and adjust <span class="cmd">PREFIX</span> to point to your
desired location where the software should reside. Some prefer
<span class="path">/usr/local</span>, others prefer <span class="path">/usr/local/synctool</span>, while others
prefer <span class="path">/opt</span>. Pick whatever you think is best.
<p>

On your master node, run <span class="cmd">make install</span>. This copies the commands
to the selected location and sets up symlinks for:
<pre class="example">
synctool        -&gt; synctool_master.py
synctool-config -&gt; synctool_config.py
synctool-ping   -&gt; synctool_ping.py
dsh-ping        -&gt; synctool_ping.py
synctool-ssh    -&gt; synctool_ssh.py
dsh             -&gt; synctool_ssh.py
synctool-scp    -&gt; synctool_scp.py
dcp             -&gt; synctool_scp.py
synctool-aggr   -&gt; synctool_aggr.py
</pre>
It also creates the master repository under <span class="path">/var/lib/synctool/</span>.
<p>
<h3>synctool configuration: nodes and groups</h3>
Copy the <span class="path">synctool.conf.example</span> to <span class="path">/var/lib/synctool/synctool.conf</span>
and edit it, adjusting it as needed. For an explanation of all configurable parameters,
see <a href="#part_four">chapter 4</a>.
<p>
<span style="path">synctool.conf</span> describes what your cluster looks like; what nodes
have what roles, and how synctool can contact them.
Think a bit about what role each machine has. There is no need to
go into great depth right now; you can always adjust the configuration
later.
<pre class="example">
node n1 interface:machine-n01
</pre>
The nodename is the &ldquo;synctool name that the node has.&rdquo; It is in
general the short hostname of the host, but in fact it can be anything you
like. The nodename has nothing to do with hostnames or DNS entries.
The interface specifies how synctool can contact the node; this can be an
IP address or a DNS name of the host you wish to contact. In clusters, there
is often a management network interface &mdash; configure that interface name
here.
<p>
It is good practice to label your master node as &lsquo;master&rsquo; or &lsquo;install&rsquo;.
<pre class="example">
node n1 master interface:machine-n01
</pre>
Now <span class="system">n1</span> responds to the groups <span class="system">n1</span>
and <span class="system">master</span>.
<p>
Some people don't like managing the master node itself with synctool.
While it <em>is</em> possible and perfectly alright to do this, some like to
exclude the master node by default:
<pre class="example">
ignore_node n1
</pre>
You have to list each and every host.
In the <span class="path">contrib/</span> directory, there is a script that
uses <span class="cmd">nmap ping</span> with
which you can scan your management network and quickly turn it into
a synctool configuration. This makes life a bit easier.
<p>
Nodes can be in as many different groups as you like. You can split
long lines of node definitions by ending them with a backslash:
<pre class="example">
node n101 workernode debian plasma mathworks solar \
          fsmounted backup interface:if0-n101
</pre>
<div class="note">
Mind that in practice, synctool repositories are generally easiest
maintainable with as few groups as possible. Make sure to use
logical names for logical groups, and use a top-down group structure.
Make things easy on yourself.
</div>
<p>
If you have many nodes that all share the same long list of groups,
the groups may be abbreviated by defining a <em>compound</em> group. This
compound group must be defined before defining the nodes:
<pre class="example">
group wn workernode debian plasma mathworks solar \
         fsmounted backup

node 101 wn interface:if0-n101
</pre>
<h3>Testing with dsh</h3>
After filling in a couple of nodes in <span class="path">synctool.conf</span>, try the command
<span class="cmd">dsh-ping</span> to see if the nodes are &lsquo;up&rsquo;.
If they are, try <span class="cmd">dsh hostname</span>, <span class="cmd">dsh uptime</span>,
or <span class="cmd">dsh date</span>.
If you correctly set up passwordless SSH, <span class="cmd">dsh</span> should run the commands
on every node without problems or needed manual intervention.
It is important that this works, before proceeding.
<div class="note">
Some (mostly IBM) systems already have a <span class="cmd">dsh</span> command.
In synctool, <span class="cmd">dsh</span> is a symbolic link to
<span class="cmd">synctool-ssh</span>. The same goes for <span class="cmd">dcp</span>,
which is a symlink to <span class="cmd">synctool-scp</span>.
</div>
<h3>Your first synctool run</h3>
Now that you have a rough setup on the master node, try running
synctool to a single node:
<pre class="example">
synctool -n anodename
</pre>
If you get <span class="system">command not found</span>, add
<span class="path">/opt/synctool/sbin</span> to your
<span class="system">PATH</span> environment variable.
By default, the full path to the command is:
<pre class="example">
/opt/synctool/sbin/synctool -n anodename
</pre>
There should be some output message saying <span class="system">DRY RUN</span>.
This means that synctool is now working. You can try running synctool across all nodes:
<pre class="example">
synctool
</pre>
Check that every node responds. If it doesn't, go back to the step where
we tested the setup using <span class="cmd">dsh</span>.
When synctool to every node works, the basic setup is done and
you can start filling your repository with useful files.
<p>
<h3>Client installation</h3>
As you may have noticed, we never installed any client software on the nodes.
There is no client installation step; the master node automatically
updates synctool on the client nodes. The binaries needed for this are
located under <span class="path">/var/lib/synctool/sbin/</span>, and this
directory gets synced to the nodes with <span class="cmd">rsync</span>.
</div>

<div class="vtab"> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>

<h2 id="part_three">3. Using synctool</h2>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="note">
In synctool terminology, a &ldquo;node&rdquo; is a host, a computer in a group of
computers. A group of computers is called a cluster.
</div>
The main power of synctool is the fact that you can define logical groups,
and you can add these to a filename as a filename extension. This will result
in the file being copied, only if the node belongs to the same group.
The groups a node is in, are defined in the <span class="path">synctool.conf</span> file.
In the configuration file, the nodename is associated with one or more groups.
The nodename itself can also be used as a group to indicate that a file
belongs to that node.
<p>
<h3>The masterdir</h3>
Once you've installed and setup synctool, you will have a <span class="system">masterdir</span>
repository on the master node of your cluster. This <span class="system">masterdir</span>
is configured in the <span class="path">synctool.conf</span> file, and is by default set to
<span class="path">/var/lib/synctool</span>.
<p>
synctool is usually run from the master node.
It will use <span class="cmd">rsync</span> to mirror the
<span class="system">masterdir</span> to all the nodes in the cluster.
If you do have the luxury of a high performance shared filesystem on your cluster,
you may use the option <span class="system">--skip-rsync</span>
to skip the mirroring of the repository.<br>
Note that it is perfectly possible to run <span class="cmd">synctool.py</span> &lsquo;stand alone&rsquo; on a
node, in which case it will check its local copy of the repository. It will
not synchronize with the master repository, since it all works with <em>server push</em>
and not client pull.
<p>
In the synctool masterdir there are by default five subdirectories, each having its own
function:
<pre class="example">
* overlay/
* delete/
* scripts/
* tasks/
* sbin/
</pre>
The <span class="path">overlay/</span> tree contains files that have to be copied. When synctool
detects a difference between a file on the system and a file in the overlay
tree, the file will be copied from the <span class="path">overlay</span> tree onto the system.
<p>
The <span class="path">delete/</span> tree contains files that always have to be deleted from the
system. Only the filename matters, so it is OK if the files in this tree are
only 0 bytes in size.
<p>
The executables in the <span class="path">scripts/</span> directory are executables that synctool can
run when needed. By means of the <span class="system">on_update</span> directive
in the <span class="path">synctool.conf</span> file, a designated script may be executed
when a certain file is changed.
For example: when <span class="path">/etc/inetd.conf</span> is updated,
the script <span class="cmd">hupdaemon.sh inetd</span> must be run.
<p>
The executables in de <span class="path">tasks/</span> directory are run when synctool is invoked with
the <span class="system">-t</span> or <span class="system">--tasks</span> argument.
This makes it possible to run scripts on hosts, which is very convenient for doing
change management.
<p>
The <span class="path">sbin/</span> directory contains the synctool programs.
Isn't this an odd place to put binaries? Yes, but these are the &lsquo;master copies&rsquo;
of the synctool software. These are also synced to every node so that synctool
can run there.
<p>
<h3>Running synctool</h3>
For example:
<pre class="example">
root@masternode:/# synctool -qf
node3: /etc/xinetd.d/identd updated (file size mismatch)
</pre>
The file is being updated because there is a mismatch in the file size.
Should the file size be the same, synctool will calculate an MD5 checksum to
see whether the file was changed or not.
<p>
By default synctool does a <em>dry run</em>. It will not do anything but show what
would happen if this would not be a dry run. Use <span class="system">-f</span> or
<span class="system">--fix</span> to apply any changes.
<p>
<h3>Adding actions to updates</h3>
Now I would like the <span class="cmd">xinetd</span> to be automatically
reloaded after I change the <span class="path">identd</span> file.
There are two ways to do this in synctool:
<ol>
<li>Old, classic way, the way it was done in synctool version <= 3.0.<br>
Put in <span class="path">synctool.conf</span>:
<pre class="example">
on_update  /etc/xinetd.d/identd    /etc/init.d/xinetd reload
</pre>
<li>Modern way, synctool version >= 4.0, much easier;<br>
Put in file <span class="path">$masterdir/overlay/etc/xinetd.d/identd.post</span>:
<pre class="example">
 /etc/init.d/xinetd reload
</pre>
The <span class="system">.post</span> script will be run when the file changes:
<pre class="example">
root@masternode:/# synctool -qf
node3: /etc/xinetd.d/identd updated (file size mismatch)
node3: running command $masterdir/overlay/etc/xinetd.d/identd.post
</pre>
</ol>
It is possible to put a group extension on the <span class="system">.post</span> script,
so that you can have one group of nodes perform different actions than an other.
<p>
The example for <span class="path">/etc/xinetd.d</span> is interesting because you
can also put an <span class="system">on_update</span> trigger or <span class="system">.post</span>
script on the directory itself.
Whenever a file in the directory gets modified, the trigger will be called.
So, we can simplify the situation for <span class="path">/etc/xinetd.d</span> to:
<pre class="example">
on_update   /etc/xinetd.d    /etc/init.d/xinetd reload
</pre>
or <span class="path">$masterdir/overlay/etc/xinetd.d.post</span>:
<pre class="example">
/etc/init.d/xinetd reload
</pre>
<h3>Special group names</h3>
The next example shows that the nodename can be used as a group.
In the example, the <span class="path">fstab</span> file is identical
throughout the cluster, with the exception of node5 and node7.
<pre class="example">
root@masternode:/# ls -F /var/lib/synctool/overlay/etc
fstab._all          motd.production._batch  sudoers._all
fstab._node5        nsswitch.conf._all      sysconfig/
fstab._node7        nsswitch.conf.old._all  sysctl.conf._all
</pre>
Group <span class="system">all</span> implictly applies to all nodes.
Likewise, there is an implicit group <span class="system">none</span> that applies
to no nodes. Group <span class="system">none</span> can be
convenient when you to have a copy of a file around, but do not wish to push
it to any nodes yet.
<p>
<h3>Useful options</h3>
The <span class="system">-q</span> option of synctool gives less output:
<pre class="example">
root@masternode:/# synctool -q
node3: /etc/xinetd.d/identd updated (file size mismatch)
node3: running command /bin/rm /etc/xinetd.d/*.saved ;
/etc/init.d/xinetd reload
</pre>
If <span class="system">-q</span> still gives too much output, because you have
many nodes in your cluster, it is possible to specify <span class="system">-a</span>
to condense (aggregate) output.
The condensed output groups together output that is the same for many nodes.<br>
<span class="cmd">synctool -qa</span> is one of my favorite commands.
synctool does this by piping the output through the <span class="cmd">synctool-aggr</span> command.
You may also use this to condense output from <span class="cmd">dsh</span>, for example
<pre class="example">
# dsh date | synctool-aggr
</pre>
or just
<pre class="example">
# dsh -a date

# dsh-ping -a
</pre>
The <span class="system">-f</span> or <span class="system">--fix</span> option
applies all changes. Always be sure to run synctool
at least once as a dry run! (without <span class="system">-f</span>).
Mind that synctool does not lock the repository and does not guard against
concurrent use by multiple sysadmins at once. In practice, this hardly ever
leads to any problems.
<p>
To update only a single file rather than all files, use the option
<span class="system">--single</span> or <span class="system">-1</span>
(that's a number one, not the letter ell).
<p>
If you want to check what file synctool is using for a given destination
file, use the <span class="system">-r</span> or <span class="system">--ref</span> option:
<pre class="example">
root@masternode:/# synctool -q -n node1 -r /etc/resolv.conf
node1: /etc/resolv.conf._somegroup
</pre>
To inspect differences between the master copy and the client copy of a file,
use <span class="system">--diff</span> or <span class="system">-d</span>.
<p>
synctool can be run on a subset of nodes, a group, or even on individual
nodes using the options <span class="system">--group</span> or
<span class="system">-g</span>, <span class="system">--node</span>
or <span class="system">-n</span>, <span class="system">--exclude</span>
or <span class="system">-x</span>, and <span class="system">--exclude-group</span>
or <span class="system">-X</span>. This also works for <span class="cmd">dsh</span>
and <span class="cmd">dcp</span>, as well as <span class="cmd">dsh-ping</span>.
For example:
<pre class="example">
# synctool -g batch,sched -X rack8
</pre>
Another example:
<pre class="example">
# dsh -n node1,node2,node3 date
</pre>
or copy a file to these three nodes:
<pre class="example">
# dcp -n node1,node2,node3 -d /tmp patchfile-1.0.tar.gz
</pre>
You may also wish to pull a file from a node into the repository. You can do
this from the masternode like this:
<pre class="example">
# synctool -n node1 --upload /path/to/file
</pre>
It may be desirable to give the file a different group extension than the
default proposed by synctool:
<pre class="example">
# synctool -n node1 --upload /path/to/file --suffix=somegroup
</pre>
After rebooting a cluster, use dsh-ping to see if the nodes respond to ping
yet. You may also do this on a group of nodes:
<pre class="example">
# dsh-ping -g rack4
</pre>
The <span class="system">-t</span> or <span class="system">--tasks</span>
option runs the de executables that are in <span class="path">tasks/</span>
(if you also supply <span class="system">-f</span>..!)
These executables can also have classnames as filename extension.
They can be shell scripts or any other kind of executables.
This option is particularly useful for making system changes
that cannot be done easily by replacing a configuration file, like for
example installing new software packages. Mind to always include a check to
see whether the system change has already been made, or else it will always
keep installing the same software when it was already there. Doing system
changes through the tasks mechanism is recommended for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>easy to see what changes are being done; all tasks are in <span class="system">tasks/</span>
<li>whenever a node is down, it can do the updates later to get back in sync
</ul>
By default, <span class="system">--tasks</span> is not being run.
You have to explicitly specify this argument to run tasks.
<p>
The <span class="system">-v</span> option gives verbose output.
This is another way of displaying the logic that synctool performs:
<pre class="example">
# synctool -v
node3: checking $masterdir/overlay/etc/tcpd_banner.production._all
node3: overridden by $masterdir/overlay/etc/tcpd_banner.production._batch
node3: checking $masterdir/overlay/etc/issue.net.production._all
node3: checking $masterdir/overlay/etc/syslog.conf._all
node3: checking $masterdir/overlay/etc/issue.production._all
node3: checking $masterdir/overlay/etc/modules.conf._all
node3: checking $masterdir/overlay/etc/hosts.allow.production._interactive
node3: skipping $masterdir/overlay/etc/hosts.allow.production._interactive,
it is not one of my groups
</pre>
The <span class="system">--unix</span> option produces
<span class="smallcaps">UNIX</span>-style output.
This shows in standard shell syntax just what synctool is about to do.
<pre class="example">
root@masternode:/# synctool --unix
node3: # updating file /etc/xinetd.d/identd
node3: mv /etc/xinetd.d/identd /etc/xinetd.d/identd.saved
node3: umask 077
node3: cp /var/lib/synctool/overlay/etc/xinetd.d/identd._all /etc/xinetd.d/identd
node3: chown root.root /etc/xinetd.d/identd
node3: chmod 0644 /etc/xinetd.d/identd
node3:
node3: # run command /bin/rm /etc/xinetd.d/*.saved ; /etc/init.d/xinetd reload
node3: /bin/rm /etc/xinetd.d/*.saved ; /etc/init.d/xinetd reload
</pre>
<div class="note">
synctool does not apply changes by executing shell commands; all
operations are programmed in Python. The <span class="system">--unix</span> option
is only a way of displaying what synctool does, and may be useful
when debugging.
</div>
The <span class="system">--skip-rsync</span> option skips the
<span class="cmd">rsync</span> run that copies the repository from the master
server to the client node. You should only specify this
option when your repository resides on a shared filesystem. Sharing the
repository between your master server and client nodes has certain security
implications, so be mindful of what you are doing in such a setup.
If you have a fast shared filesystem between all client nodes, but it is
not shared with the master server, you may want to write a wrapper script
around synctool that first runs <span class="cmd">rsync</span> to a
single node to update the shared repository, and then run synctool with
the <span class="system">--skip-rsync</span> option.
<p>
<h3>Logging</h3>
When using <span class="system">--fix</span> to apply changes, synctool can
log the performed actions in a log file.
Use the <span class="system">logfile</span> directive in
<span class="path">synctool.conf</span> to specify that you want logging:
<pre class="example">
logfile /var/log/synctool.log
</pre>
synctool will write this logfile on each node seperately, and a concatenated
log on the master node.
<p>
<h3>Ignoring them: I'm not touching you</h3>
By using directives in the <span class="path">synctool.conf</span> file,
synctool can be told to ignore certain files, nodes, or groups.
These will be excluded, skipped. For example:
<pre class="example">
ignore_dotfiles no
ignore_dotdirs yes
ignore .svn
ignore .gitignore
ignore_node node1 node2
ignore_group oldgroup
ignore_group test
</pre>
<p>
<h3>About symbolic links</h3>
On the Linux operating system, symbolic links always have mode 0777
(shown in the directory as mode <span class="system">lrwxrwxrwx</span>).
This is awkward, because this mode seems to imply that owners, group members,
and others have write access to the symbolic link &mdash;
which is not the case. This results in synctool complaining about the mode
of the symbolic link:
<pre class="example">
/path/subdir/symlink should have mode 0755 (symlink), but has 0777
</pre>
As a workaround, synctool forces the mode of the symbolic link to what
you set it to in <span class="system">synctool.conf</span>.
The hardcoded default value is 0755. Linux users should configure the
value 0777 in <span class="system">synctool.conf</span>:
<pre class="example">
# Linux
symlink_mode 0777
</pre>
<pre class="example">
# sensible mode for most other UNIX systems
symlink_mode 0755
</pre>
As synctool requires all files in the repository to have an extension,
symbolic links must have extensions too. Symbolic links in the repository
will be <em>dead</em> symlinks but they will point to the correct destination
on the target node.
Consider the following example, where <span class="system">file</span> does
not exist &lsquo;as is&rsquo; in the repository:
<pre class="example">
$masterdir/overlay/etc/motd._red -&gt; file
$masterdir/overlay/etc/file._red
</pre>
<h3>Backup copies</h3>
For any file synctool updates, it keeps a backup copy around on the target
node with the extension <span class="system">.saved</span>. If you don't
like this, you can tell synctool to not make any backup copies with:
<pre class="example">
backup_copies no
</pre>
It is however highly recommended that you run with
<span class="system">backup_copies</span> enabled.
You can manually specify that you want to remove all backup copies using
<span class="cmd">synctool -e</span> or
<span class="cmd">synctool --erase-saved</span>.
<p>
<h3>Node-specific local configuration adjustments</h3>
The settings in <span class="path">synctool.conf</span> can be overridden
locally by including a second config file that is present on the node.
<p>
<span class="system">synctool.conf</span>:
<pre class="example">
include /etc/synctool_local.conf
</pre>
The local config file may contain the same directives as the master config
file, but apply only to the node on which the file resides. The local config
file may be managed from the master repository, enabling you to have subtle
differences in the synctool configuration for certain nodes. For example,
this can be used to change the <span class="system">symlink_mode</span>
in heterogeneous clusters.
Beware that the local config file is read upon startup and may be synced
afterwards, if the file was changed.<br>
Mind that including node specific configs increases the complexity of your
overall synctool configuration, so in general it is recommended that you
stick to using the master <span class="path">synctool.conf</span> only,
and not including any local configs at all.
<p>
The <span class="system">include</span> keyword can also be used to
clean up your config a little, for example:
<pre class="example">
include /var/lib/synctool/nodes.conf
include /var/lib/synctool/colors.conf
include /var/lib/synctool/on_update.conf
</pre>
In this example all the nodes get the same config, because the masterdir
<span class="path">/var/lib/synctool/</span> is synced to all nodes.
<p>
<h3>Checking for updates</h3>
synctool can check whether a new version of synctool itself is available by
using the <span class="system">--check-update</span> option on the master node.
You can check periodically for updates by using
<span class="system">--check-update</span> in a crontab entry.
To download the latest version, run <span class="cmd">synctool --download</span>
on the master node. These functions connect to the main website at
<a href="http://www.heiho.net/synctool/">http://www.heiho.net/synctool</a>.
